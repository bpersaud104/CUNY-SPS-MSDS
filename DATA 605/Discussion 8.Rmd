# Chapter 8 Section 8.1 Exercise 3

Write a program to toss a coin 10,000 times. Let Sn be the number of heads in the first n tosses. Have your program print out, after every 1000 tosses,
Sn âˆ’ n/2. On the basis of this simulation, is it correct to say that you can expect heads about half of the time when you toss a coin a large number of times?

Solution:

```{r}
n <- 1000 # Number of tosses equal to 1000
Sn <- c() # Stores the number of heads
sum_heads <- 0 # Stores the sum of the number of heads
n <- c() # Stores the number of tosses
for(i in 1:10){
  simulation <- sample(0:1, 1000, rep = T) # Tosses coin 1000 times
  sum_heads <- sum_heads + sum(simulation == 1) # Gets the sum of heads
  Sn <- c(Sn, sum_heads / (1000 * i)) # Gets the number of heads
  n <- c(n, 1000 * i) # Gets the number of tosses
}
data_frame <- data.frame(n, Sn) # Dataframe to show the number of tosses and number of heads
data_frame
```

For my program, it runs a simulation of 1000 coin tosses, where heads is a 1 and tails is a 0, and loops through 10 times to show 10000 tosses. Each time it loops, the number of heads, the sum of heads, and the number of tosses are being stored. I created a dataframe to display every 1000 tosses and the number of heads for every 1000 tosses. Based on the simulation and the dataframe I displayed, it is correct to say that you can expect heads about half of the time when you toss a coin a large number of times. This is because you can see as the tosses go from 1000 to 10000, the number of heads are within 1/2 of the tosses.
